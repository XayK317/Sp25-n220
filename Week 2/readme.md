## Week 2

### Weekly Recap

What'd ya learn?
I learned how to add a java script to html files, still kinda confused on how making the java in a subfolder only alalows it to work, but we'll see.
Also learned that lowercasing html and not putting a space in the names of my projects is crucial to the execution of creating live links. Also how to make seperate folders and new files accordingly.
